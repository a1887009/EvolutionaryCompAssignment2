The GA starts with a randomly generated population of candidate solutions, with each run being controlled by a unique random
seed, which is a number used to initialise the random number generator, making the experiments reproducible while 
still allowing variation between runs. In each generation, tournament selection was used to choose parents. Uniform 
crossover was then used with probability 0.9 to combine genetic information, and mutation at rate 0.1 to introduce diversity. 
Elitism was included so that the previous gen's best solution was always preserved. From the data collected across 
multiple seeds, it was observed that while there is variation in performance due to randomness, the average convergence 
curves show steady logarithmic improvements in fitness over time. The standard deviation regions indicate that some runs converged
faster than others, but overall the GA shows reliable progress compared to random search, with crossover and mutation working 
together to balance exploration of the search space and exploitation of good solutions.
