The ACO begins from a neutral pheromone vector over all bit positions, and each run uses a distinct random seed to initialise
the random number generator to ensure reproducibility while still allowing variations in value. In each iteration, a colony of ants constructs
candidate solutions by sampling each bit according to its pheromone value, after which pheromones fade and are reinforced toward
stronger solutions within the bounds to avoid stagnation. A lightweight 1-bit local search is applied to refine the iterationâ€™s
solution, adding exploitation on top of pheromone-guided exploration. From the data collected across multiple seeds, it was observed 
that while there is variability due to randomness, the convergence curves show rapid early gain in the beginning followed by steady 
improvements in the fitness over time, indicating that the function improves as it goes along. The standard deviation regions indicate 
that some runs discover useful building blocks earlier and converge faster than others, but overall the ACO shows reliable progress compared 
to random search, with pheromone reinforcement and local search working together to balance exploration of the search space. Overall, the ACO 
achieves faster convergence, smoother performance, and higher best fitness values across most functions, showing that pheromone adaptation and 
local refinement together produce stronger, more consistent results over time.
